# HomeScreen

HomeScreen is a hobby project and consists of an information board that we have in the entrance area of our house. 

The project was built using UWP and is running on a Raspberry PI2 running Windows 10 IoT.

The screen displays the agenda from a joint calendar, date and time, the current weather, forecast and bus departures
